Hi, I'm Joel. I love building new ideas and indulging in new projects. I am an accomplished leader and aspiring software developer with a diverse range of experiences.

During my time as a Boy Scout, I successfully led a troop of 35+ scouts through monthly events and trips that I planned. This role required effective delegation of tasks to junior scouts, fostered teamwork, and developed essential life skills. I gained valuable insights into survival methods in the wilderness, ethical outdoor practices, and the art of leadership.

As part of my commitment to community service, I raised $1,000 for my Eagle Project and carried out the construction of a little library with a rock path in the outdoor sanctuary of my church. This was a 100-hour project and it reflects my dedication to making a positive impact on my community.

Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at UNC-Chapel Hill, I am driven by a desire to leverage my strengths in STEM to become a well-rounded software developer. My goal is to contribute to the tech industry through innovative solutions and a strong problem-solving mindset.

Beyond academics, I have pursued my passion for music, developing as a guitarist in a campus youth band. This experience has enhanced my creativity in crafting musical riffs, increased my confidence in performing in front of diverse audiences, and taught me the importance of collaboration in a band setting.

In summary, I bring a unique blend of leadership, technical aptitude, and artistic creativity to the table. I am eager to apply these skills and experiences in a professional setting by contributing to projects that align with my diverse interests and expertise.
